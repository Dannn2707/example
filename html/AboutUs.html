                            We prefer a crust that is soft and light on the inside with a crisp outer shell that can
                            stand up on its own. We want our ingredients and topping combinations to provide an
                            explosion of flavor.
                            To achieve this we use extremely hot ovens along with carefully researched dough
                            formulations, tomato varieties, and cheese blends, sparing no expense and taking no
                            shortcuts.
                            Following this tradition, Stoked has partnered with Lilliput Farms in Wareham,
                            Massachusetts. They grow organic produce for us from seeds that we discovered on trips to
                            the Campania region of Italy.

                                Ingredients are delivered to each Stoked location seven days a week so we can avoid
                                freezers, preservatives, and processed foods. New tomato and olive oil crops from all
                                around the world are compared at the end of each growing season to ensure that we have
                                the most flavorful sauces and salad dressings available anywhere.
                                We take special care to ensure that diners with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-sensitive
                                dietary preferences can find themselves having a top-quality dining experience at
                                Stoked.
                                We hope you notice our dedication to the craft of pizza when you eat at Stoked!

                                The foundation for the pizza at Stoked Pizza Company comes from meticulously studying
                                the ingredients and techniques used to produce our favorite classic pizza styles and
                                highlighting the strengths of each in what we make.
                                We are influenced by the delicate, fresh flavored pizza baked in its birthplace, Naples
                                Italy, and also by the bold ingredients with abundant char that you find at the best
                                pizzerias of New Haven and New York.

                            <p>Scott has always been obsessed with pizza, and was making dough from scratch before he
                                knew how to drive a car. The first day he got his license he drove straight to "Mama
                                Lucias" because that's the pizzeria that had the most flavorful crust and sauce.
                                When Scott moved to Boston to attend college his career in the music business took off.
                                He found himself touring the world playing bass, producing, and engineering records for
                                many successful bands. In Scott's eyes, the best part about all the traveling for music
                                was that it enabled him to seek out the tastiest pizzerias across the US and Italy.
                                Befriending and learning from the owners of these successful establishments offered
                                valuable insight into what makes crave-worthy pizza. </p>

                            <p>Toirm acquired his first job in the restaurant business at the age of 14, washing dishes
                                in a family owned Italian restaurant in Hartford, CT
                                .In 2004 Toirm decided to take a break from the restaurant business and was hired by
                                Boston Duck Tours to work as one of their famed "Conducktours", giving amphibious tours
                                of Boston.
                                Looking to keep his hand in the restaurant business, Toirm launched Boston's first
                                vegetarian food cart, Jack and the Bean Bowl which received great reviews from both the
                                Boston Globe and the Boston Phoenix.
                                When not at the restaurant, Toirm is with his nine-year-old daughter and wife,
                                explaining to them he cannot eat pizza on his day off.</p>
