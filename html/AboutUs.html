        <p>We prefer a crust that is soft and light on the inside with a crisp outer shell that can stand up on its own. We want our ingredients and topping combinations to provide an explosion of flavor. To achieve this we use extremely hot ovens along with carefully researched dough formulations, tomato varieties, and cheese blends, sparing no expense and taking no shortcuts. Following this tradition, Stoked has partnered with Lilliput Farms in Wareham, Massachusetts. They grow organic produce for us from seeds that we discovered on trips to the Campania region of Italy.</p>
