        <p>We prefer a crust that is soft and light on the inside with a crisp outer shell that can stand up on its own.
            We want our ingredients and topping combinations to provide an explosion of flavor. To achieve this we use
            extremely hot ovens along with carefully researched dough formulations, tomato varieties, and cheese blends,
            sparing no expense and taking no shortcuts. Following this tradition, Stoked has partnered with Lilliput
            Farms in Wareham, Massachusetts. They grow organic produce for us from seeds that we discovered on trips to
            the Campania region of Italy.</p>

            Ingredients are delivered to each Stoked location seven days a week so we can avoid freezers, preservatives,
            and processed foods. New tomato and olive oil crops from all around the world are compared at the end of
            each growing season to ensure that we have the most flavorful sauces and salad dressings available anywhere.
            We take special care to ensure that diners with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-sensitive dietary preferences
            can find themselves having a top-quality dining experience at Stoked. We hope you notice our dedication to
            the craft of pizza when you eat at Stoked!

        <p>The foundation for the pizza at Stoked Pizza Company comes from meticulously
            studying the ingredients and techniques used to produce our favorite classic pizza styles and highlighting
            the strengths of each in what we make. We are influenced by the delicate, fresh flavored pizza baked in its
            birthplace, Naples Italy, and also by the bold ingredients with abundant char that you find at the best
            pizzerias of New Haven and New York.</p>

            <p> Toirm acquired his first job in the restaurant business at the age of 14, washing dishes in a family
                owned
                Italian restaurant in Hartford, CT.
                ​
                In 2004 Toirm decided to take a break from the restaurant business and was hired by Boston Duck Tours to
                work as one of their famed "Conducktours", giving amphibious tours of Boston.
                ​
                Looking to keep his hand in the restaurant business, Toirm launched Boston's first vegetarian food cart,
                Jack and the Bean Bowl which received great reviews from both the Boston Globe and the Boston Phoenix.
                ​
                When not at the restaurant, Toirm is with his 13 year-old daughter and wife, explaining to them he
                cannot
                eat pizza on his day off.

                Scott has always been obsessed with pizza, and was making dough from scratch before he knew how to drive
                a car.   The first day he got his license he drove straight to "Mama Lucias" because that's the pizzeria
                that had the most flavorful crust and sauce.
                 
                When Scott moved to Boston to attend college his career in the music business took off.  He found
                himself touring the world playing bass, producing, and engineering records for many successful bands. In
                Scott's eyes, the best part about all the traveling for music was that it enabled him to seek out the
                tastiest pizzerias across the US and Italy. Befriending and learning from the owners of these successful
                establishments offered valuable insight into what makes crave-worthy pizza.
